# ZHW Shoes Layout

## Objectives

1. Develop HTML and CSS competency
2. Practice visually interpreting HTML and CSS code from the rendered DOM
3. Practice jumping into, and contributing to, an existing code base

</p>


## Instructions

1. Open `index.html` in your browser to see what we have so far (most of the work is completed already)
2. Write the necessary CSS in `css/layout.css` to create classes for a three column grid
3. Update `index.html` to make use of your newly created CSS classes 
4. Either provide sized tile classes, make use of [the clearfix hack][Clearfix] using `float` and `clear`, or use your own implementation to accurately fill the columns with content

**Note:** This lab has less direction than previous labs. As programmers in 
training, you are expected to use your Google-Fu to complete the challenge!
