/* This is one (incomplete) way to make columns:
#wood .wrapper { 
  column-count: 3; /* I tried using "columns: 32% 3;", but that didn't work. Also, I think the default column-width is auto, thus only "column-count" is needed here.
  /* It looks like column-width won't accept %, and it is a minimum width (NOT the same as the same as the length of spacing, which is column-gap).
  /* I also can't use "column-gap: 2%;" either, as that property doesn't accept %.
  /* column-rule-width: 2%; Again, this won't accept % values.
    column-rule-style: dashed;
    column-rule-width: 200px;
    OK, so as I discovered, column-rule has NO effect on the spacing between columns.
}

#wood .wrapper .shadow:first-child, #wood .wrapper > h2 {
  column-span: all;
} */

/* Unfortunately, while I can specify "all" or "none" for "column-span", I can't specify the EXACT NUMBER of columns to span. */
/* Unless I make a second wrapper class in the HTML around the featured brands and archive list, I can't seem to use the above properties to make two columns that line up with three columns below them. */
/* But THEN, I would need to make a THIRD wrapper to style the deals in column format! I may attempt all of that at another time. */

/* End of the other way to make columns. */ 

/* Here's a better, though not the best, way to make columns; see note under "Positioning Classes". */
/* It may be better if I use px instead of %, as it would be more consistent with other properties specified elsewhere for the same elements. */
